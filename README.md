My Project Repository

This is my first games programming project, likely in Javascript or Unreal Engine, and this is some <code>code for the project</code> As this course progresses so too I am hoping will my ability to programme a really cool game. I'm currently thinking along the lines of a narrative that allows for several digressions from the main story arc, with user-driven control over story setting and narrative. The primary aim of this game will likely marry digital literacy with the humanities to establish a bridge or confluence of two worlds — a principle that has worked extremely well in the past with respect to game development. I am also aspiring to create a game that can be played offline if, for no other reason, than to increase the likelihood of actual human interaction that will reflect computer-driven engagement. In this regard, I am examining how offline and traditional games are created (Monopoly, Cops and Robbers, Cricket etc.) to understand the deeper fundamentals of gameplay and game design. Ultimately, the practice of game-development is rooted in the principles of consumer engagement and consumer entertainment, and this I am hoping will serve as a mantra — to convert passive recipients of data, into active participants of information.


---10 October 2017---
Following with this thread I now have a clearer idea of what type of game I would like to build. I am interested in building one of two games (unless time and resources permit, in which case I will builf both games). The first and more ambitious game will be a maze-like scenario built with jQuery and JavaScript. The game would involve a degree of strategy and planning — for example can a player move from one side of the maze to the other in the shortest possbile steps. An alternative scenario to this would be to create a bricks-like game where bricks from the top keep falling and moving tray / paddle at the bottom is controlled by the player to shoot left and right in order to catch the bricks and tip them into a safety bin before attempting to catch the next falling one. Variances in level design would include bricks falling faster and the safety bin getting smaller. The safety bin might also move position as the game progresses. I believe the simplicity of the game (and complexity of the code in JS / jQuery) might make this an idea console or mobile game and I will be shortly starting to build this out and sandbox it in a web browser. My index.html file here on Github will hold the commits for the code, while this readme file will continue to hold the analysis, plans, insights, learnings, and execution strategies.
